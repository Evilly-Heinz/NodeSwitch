# CI for NodeSwitch: build, test, publish, and optional MSIX packaging
# - By default this workflow publishes the app (dotnet publish) and uploads the published output.
# - If you need an MSIX/AppPackages produced, set the job-level env BUILD_MSIX: 'true'
#   and provide the packaging (.wapproj) via Wap_Project_Path and a Base64 PFX secret + Pfx_Key.
#
# Notes:
# - We avoid using unquoted env expressions inside multiline upload globs (that caused the parser error).
# - Published outputs are uploaded from artifacts/publish/** (guaranteed by dotnet publish -o).
# - MSIX upload steps are conditional on BUILD_MSIX == 'true'.
# - If you enable MSIX packaging, ensure your repo contains a .wapproj or packaging project and that
#   Wap_Project_Path points at it (relative path). Provide secrets Base64_Encoded_Pfx and Pfx_Key.
